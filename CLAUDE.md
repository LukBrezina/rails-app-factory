# CLAUDE.md

Read the README first — its "Architecture" section is the handoff document:
big picture, naming conventions, session lifecycle, deploy/backup internals,
and a Gotchas list of non-obvious constraints (bundler-env stripping into
tmux, Turbo Drive deliberately off, claude's process title, xterm FitAddon
padding, tailwind-watcher TTY). Don't undo those without reading why.

## Commands

- `bin/rails test` — the suite (fast; includes subprocess tests of bin/hook)
- `bin/rails tailwindcss:build` — required after CSS/token changes if no watcher runs
- `RAF_PROJECTS_DIR=<dir> bin/dev` — run locally (foreman needs a TTY; headless: `tailwindcss:build` + `bin/rails server`)

## Hard rules

- tmux is the source of truth for sessions — don't add session DB tables
  without migrating that model deliberately.
- Names: `<app>--<session>`; the `/\A\w+(?:-\w+)*\z/` validation makes `--`
  unambiguous. Session/app inputs are free text, parameterized to slugs.
- `bin/hook` executes under each app's own Ruby — keep its syntax
  old-Ruby-compatible.
- All UI copy targets someone who never coded: deploy→"go live",
  restore→"rewind", worktree→"private workspace", attached→"open in a browser".
- Long-running work (create, deploy, restore) runs in visible tmux sessions
  named `<app>--setup/deploy/restore` — keep that pattern for new features.
